## To run the code:
You need to use `e` tag for encryption `d` tag for decryption 
Second argument of the program should be the keyfile. You need to add keyfile in src/pkg directory to use as a encryption key
Third argument of the program should be the input file that needs to be encrpyt or decrypt
Use this command in `src/pkg` directory

For decryption:
-  `java AES.java d keyfile inputfile`

For encryption:
- `java AES.java e keyfile inputfile`
